		<string>Arguably at the top of the list of greatest engineers is Nikola Tesla. He was Serbian, and moved to America at the age of 28 to work with Thomas Edison. Tesla is perhaps one of the most underrated electrical engineers, and didnâ€™t receive credit for a lot of his inventions.

Thereâ€™s no doubt that he had a huge influence on society, though. His inventions include the induction motor, 3-phase electricity, fluorescent lighting and the Tesla coil. He also developed the AC current generation system made from a transformer and a motor.</string>

		<string>Henry Ford was an engineer and industrialist who founded the Ford Motor Company. The rest is history. Although not the inventor of the modern car, he developed assembly and production lines that brought about mass production â€“ resulting in the first motor car that an average person could afford. As a result, he turned the automobile into something of a necessity rather than just a thing of curiosity.</string>

		<string>A Scottish born engineer, scientist and inventor, Alexander Graham Bell is credited with providing us with the first telephone. His work was strongly influenced by the fact that unusually both his mother and wife were deaf. This led him to focus on the areas of elocution and speech, and eventually experimenting with hearing devices. The first U.S. patent for the telephone was awarded to him way back in 1876. He also had many other inventions in later life, including in aeronautics and optical telecommunications.</string>
